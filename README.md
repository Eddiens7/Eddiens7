Hi! I'm *Edmon Nascimento*, and this is my GitHub space where I share my web development and programming learning projects.  

## What This Repo Contains

- **Learning Projects**: These are small, hands-on projects where I experiment with different aspects of web development. You will find basic static web pages, form submissions, and interactive features like to-do lists or simple games.
- **Code Challenges**: As part of my learning, I solve challenges from platforms like [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/).
- **Tutorials & Notes**: Sometimes, I add code snippets, notes, or guides to help myself and others learn. Feel free to browse these resources if you're on a similar learning path.

Let's code!
